Enclosed in this submission are:  
 * diskinfo.c - which displays information about the disk given  
 * disklist.c - which displays the contents of the root directory and all subdirectories    
 * diskget.c - which finds a file within the disk and copies it out  
 * diskput.c - which copies a file into either the disk root directory or a subdirectory  
 * Makefile - to compile all of the above at once with ease.  
    
  
After invoking the makefile with "make" each executable can be run as:   
>./diskinfo disk.IMA  
  
>./disklist disk.IMA  
  
>./diskget disk.IMA file  
  
>./diskput disk.IMA (/sublayer/)file
